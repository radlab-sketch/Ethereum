## Ethereum smart contract

The smart contract provided here was written using Solidity v0.6.0. The code was developed with three nodes in the network. The smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum network using the Truffle suite.

Step 1.

The address of the Ethereum accounts for each of the nodes are stored in three string variables, ```dataA```, ```dataB```, and ```dataC```. 

Step 2.

Deploy the smart contract using your preferred client such as MetaMask, Geth, or Truffle.
