## Ethereum smart contract

The smart contract provided here was written using Solidity v0.6.0. The code was developed with three nodes in the network. The smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum network using the Truffle suite.

Step 1.

The address of the Ethereum accounts for each member of the private network should be stored in these three string variables, ```dataA```, ```dataB```, and ```dataC```. This makes up the access control list for the three members in the network.

Step 2.

Deploy the smart contract using your preferred client such as MetaMask, Geth, or Truffle.

Installation instructions for the Truffle suite can be found in https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation
